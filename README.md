# Fireworks Text Visualizer
### Working:
It detects brighter pixels usinh numpy and displayes random celebration slogans dynamically and highlights the detected part with rectangles.It comnverts each frame to 
"HSV Color space" to detect colors.and write that stufff and then save it in mp4 version.But you cant run this big ahh video on you 55gb phone so you gotta re-encode it using ffmpeg.
```bash
ffmpeg -i final.mp4 -vcodec libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p fixed.mp4
```
And if you're one of my dumb ah friends from my ig reel so here are the steps awe <3
OFC you'd have python installed already ,run this shit in your terminal

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
Place your video to the same dir as your file.And just run the program and do the re-encode shii I've mentioned above.

It doesnâ€™t use a real AI or deep learning mode LMAO just opencv and color detection.
